# Car Price Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing car price data using the pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization of individual variables, correlation analysis, and identification of important variables for predicting car prices.

## Getting Started

To run the code, make sure you have Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory containing the code.

Run the Jupyter notebook `car_price_analysis.ipynb` to execute the code and visualize the results.

## Code Overview

The Jupyter notebook `car_price_analysis.ipynb` contains the following sections:

1. Data Preparation: Loading the dataset and examining its structure.
2. Visualization of Individual Variables: Exploring the relationships between individual variables and car prices using scatterplots and boxplots.
3. Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Calculating basic statistics for continuous variables and value counts for categorical variables.
4. Basics of Grouping: Grouping data by different categories and performing analysis on the individual groups.
5. Correlation and Causation: Calculating Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values to determine the relationships between variables and car prices.
6. Conclusion: Identifying the important variables for predicting car prices based on correlation analysis.

## Results

The analysis reveals several important variables that significantly impact car prices, including engine size, horsepower, length, width, curb weight, city mpg, and highway mpg. These variables can be used as features for building machine learning models to automate the prediction of car prices.
